    The problem is that the computation of the constant MICROS_PER_DAY does overflow.
    Although the result of the computation fits in a long with room to spare, it doesn't fit in an int.
    The computation is performed entirely in int arithmetic, and only after the computation
    completes is the result promoted to a long.
    So why is the computation performed in int arithmetic?
    Because all the factors that are multiplied together are int values.
    When you multiply two int values, you get another int value.
